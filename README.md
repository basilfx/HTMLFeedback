HTMLFeedback is a Google like feedback tool, based on jQuery and HTML2Canvas. Since it uses the canvas element, browsers supporting the canvas element should work with this plugin. You can disable the canvas overlay and use [FlashCanvas](http://flashcanvas.net/) for rendering, but it has not been tested.

The plugin does not include a GUI/Form. It only handles the logic to draw markers and overlay, render the canvas and upload it. However, adding a GUI is a piece of cake, and you can always copy one from the examples. This way, you can integrate it in any environment, the way you like it!

## Requirements

* jQuery 1.7+
* HTML2Canvas

## Demos

Two examples are available online. Check them out!

## Compatibility

HTMLFeedback is Beta, so please help me find bugs!
